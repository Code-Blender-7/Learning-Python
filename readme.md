# Hey there.

Welcome to the repository of Learning Python. This is a educational-type of a repo where I find and solve questions and answers related to the python language. 

Because that the python language is evolving and many features are being modified, each of the repo python files would have their *__python version__* described in them.

This repository is quite young but i hope to develop this repository over time as i explore the language of python. 

Some of the answers may come from other authors. I be sure to mention their social media on the readme files.
