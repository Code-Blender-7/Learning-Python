# Computer VS. Computer Guessing Game

A guessing game that is created in python. Instead of the traditional guessing games between humans and computers, this short program is created to show that how many attempts the computer needs before it can successfully figure out the answer.

The code uses random seeds and generators to help change the value every time the code is ran on the while loop causing the computer's answer to not be the same. 


It's a short program so I hope that you guys can understand it!
