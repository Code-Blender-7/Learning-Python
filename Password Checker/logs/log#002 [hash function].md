4This log is dedicated to the hash and its functions.


Hash is a fixed line code that is created from the original string. It is a syntax that is used everywhere. 

Hash can be md5, sha1, sha256 etc. 

REMAINDER:
md5 however is lower form. add a upper() to the string to create a proper code that looks like a sha1.



the hash function works like this.
At first, it will take a key of the string and then it will change the value to the hash table value. 

here is a point, sha1 takes longer because that it's function takes longer. 

hash is simply a string turned into letters and numebrs of the hash table.

if you understood this, then that means that you are ready to build the program.
